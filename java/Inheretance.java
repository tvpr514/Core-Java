/*
Types of inheretance 
1.single level inheretance
2.multi level inheretance
3.multiple inheretance, it is not supported.(single class inhereting 2 or more classes)

/* It is process of inheriting propertis from one class to another classs

IS-A Relationship(Getting properties from  super class to sub class)(object is created using same class)

Has-A Relationship(Creating relation between different independet classes)(Object is created using other class)

Advantage: Code Reusability.

Do we call is-a ,Has-a relation as inheritance?
