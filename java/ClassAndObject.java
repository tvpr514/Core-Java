/* Class defines the structure of an object ,class is nothing but blueprint.
   To creat object and to store its data in heap memeory we need 'new' key word.  { A obj = new A() } This will 
creat new object of  class A and it is called as instance.
'obj' is Refference and '()' is constructor
To call a particular method we do it as "obj.method()"
obj is Refference varaible
int X ect are primitive variables
Obj is assigned a #code which is identity of data in heap memory
  If we assign a new data to an object the the old data of the object in the heap memory is 
sent to garbage collection.
Constructor provide the exacct memory required of the object.
